# Harbor Plugins

Plugins are used to run post-process tasks like starting the storybook development server, optimizing the assets or include a file watcher.
These can be defined by adding the given CLI argument hooks within your command:

```sh
$ node node_modules/@toolbarthomas/harbor/index.js --task=javascripts --minify
```

## üîå Default Plugins

More plugins can be included within a single command, the following plugins are available within the default configuration, the result of certain plugins can vary between environments:

| Plugin             | Environment        | Description                                                                                 | Hook(s)               |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| JSOptimizer        | production `only`  | Minifies the defined js entries within the THEME_DIST directory                             | minify                |
| StyleOptimizer     | production `only`  | Minifies the defined css entries within the THEME_DIST directory                            | minify                |
| StyleguideCompiler | production         | Creates a static storybook styleguide.                                                      | storybook, styleguide |
| StyleguideCompiler | development        | Starts the storybook development server.                                                    | storybook, styleguide |
| Watcher            | development `only` | Watches the configured instance entries and runs the assigned workers during a file change. | watch                 |

This will only generate the actual assets that should be compatible for the Drupal environment.
Keep in mind that this command will only run the configured Harbor workers, the actual development tools can be included with extra CLI arguments:

```sh
$ node node_modules/@toolbarthomas/harbor/index.js --task=javascripts --minify --watch
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Plugin configuration

### AssetExporter configuration

The AssetExporter wraps the defined entry templates as a valid module export template literal.
It is possible to include an optional literal function within the actual asset by defining a new `includeLiteral` Object within the options.

| Option                          | type   | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| options                         | Object | Optional configuration for the AssetExporter.                                                      |
| options.includeLiteral          | Object | Assigns Babel module-resolver aliases to the Storybook instance.                                   |
| options.includeLiteral[].entry  | String | Should match with the defined entry name, a custom literal will be included when there is a match. |
| options.includeLiteral[].export | String | The actual literal that can be prefixed with.                                                      |
| options.includeLiteral[].import | String | The actual import source for the optional module literal.                                          |

### StyleguideCompiler configuration

The Styleguide Compiler will generate a new Storybook instance for the defined `THEME_ENVIRONMENT` value.

A Storybook development version can be launched by defining `THEME_ENVIRONMENT='development'` within your environment configuration.

This will launch a new Storybook development server with the Storybook CLI.
More information about the usage of this server can be found on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs)

You can also create a static version of your Storybook instance by setting `THEME_ENVIRONMENT` to `production`.
This static styleguide will be written to the defined `THEME_DEST` destination and will resolve the processed assets within the static package.
Keep in mind that some assets cannot be displayed when viewing the static HTML document directly for security reasons.

This can be resolved by viewing the actual result from a (local) webserver.
